<h3><u><strong>Selenium&nbsp;Tutorial Online:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium Webdriver Training Online&nbsp;Core is born whose performance underlies the Selenium RC (Rc) and Selenium IDE tools. The Limit of getting a JavaScript established automation engine and browser security was a disadvantage of Selenium to special functionality. Google, was the extended time person of Selenium and that they had a programmer named Simon Stewart who produced WebDriver.</p>

<p>This instrument evaded Selenium&#39;s JavaScript sandbox to allow it to talk to the Browser and Operating System directly using <a href="http://seleniumtestingtutorials.com/selenium-testing-tutorial-tool-for-beginners/" target="_blank">native methods</a>. In 2008, Selenium and WebDriver blended technologies and intellectual wisdom to provide the perfect test automation framework.Selenium Webdriver Training&nbsp;offers some testing functions specifically geared to the needs of testing of a internet program. Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online operations are highly adaptable, enabling many options for setting UI elements and comparing anticipated evaluation results against real application behavior.</p>

<h3><strong>Elements of Selenium are the following:</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Selenium IDE</li>
	<li>Selenium Remote Control</li>
	<li>Selenium Grid</li>
</ul>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium IDE:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium IDE is an integrated development environment for Selenium Webdriver Training Online tests and is implemented as a Firefox extension, and lets you record, edit, and replay the evaluation in firefox. It permits you to save evaluations as HTML, Java, Ruby scripts, or any format and therefore enables you to automatically add assertions to all of the pages. Selenium IDE enables you to include selenese commands as and when needed.<br />
<br />
Selenium IDE has some limitations, for example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Selenium IDE can be examined only on Firefox.</li>
	<li>No Programming log-in (like loops, conditional statements) might be applied</li>
	<li>It can execute scripts developed in Selenese just.</li>
	<li>It is hard to use Selenium IDE for checking complex test cases including dynamic contents.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium Remote control:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium remote control is a great treatment for cross browser testing. It&#39;s a host, written in Java and consequently accessible on most of the platforms. It also acts as a proxy for internet requests from them. Selenium remotecontrol bundles Selenium Webdriver Training&nbsp;Center and automatically loads into the browser.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium Grid:</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium Grid scales the Selenium RC option for big test suites and evaluation that should be run in multiple environments. It helps you to run evaluations parallel with simultaneous execution (different evaluations on different remote devices). It permits for running your evaluations in a distributed test execution atmosphere. It may be used to to perform your tests against multiple browsers, multiple versions of browser, and browsers working on different operating systems. Selenium Grid takes comparatively less time for the test suite to complete a test pass.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Attributes:</u></strong></h3>

<h3><br />
<strong>The following will be the features of Selenium testing:</strong></h3>

<p>Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online testing supports Cross-Browser Testing and so it be run-on several browsers.<br />
It enables scripting in in various languages like Java, C#, PHP and Python.<br />
Its assertion statements give an effective way of comparing expected and actual consequences.<br />
It&#39;s inbuilt reporting mechanism.<br />
Using Selenium Webdriver Training as Test Automation instrument minimizes the cost incurred and additionally ensures quicker delivery. Hence it is cost effective and also not time consuming which demonstrates that this is a standard automation device for regression.</p>

<h3><strong>What is Selenium?</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Javascript framework that runs in your webbrowser</li>
	<li>Works anywhere Javascript is supported</li>
	<li>Hooks for most other languages</li>
	<li>Java, Ruby, Python</li>
	<li>Can simulate a user browsing through pages and&nbsp;then declare for specific marks on the pages</li>
	<li>All you should really know is HTML to start&nbsp;using it right away</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Where to get it?</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>You are able to use Selenium-Core and customize</li>
	<li>everything</li>
	<li>But it&#39;s easier to simply get a Firefox plugin</li>
	<li>Selenium-IDE that helps you document evaluation&nbsp;cases</li>
	<li>It&#39;s possible for you to record how an program is being utilized and&nbsp;then play back those records followed by&nbsp;asserts</li>
	<li>Test Creation Demo</li>
	<li>Create test case to log into the gallery</li>
	<li>Create test case to log out of the gallery</li>
	<li>Executing the Test Suite</li>
	<li>Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Core is an assortment of Javascript and&nbsp;HTML with iFrames</li>
	<li>Due to security problems Core must be&nbsp;deployed within an identical server as the&nbsp;application being hosted</li>
	<li>The simplest solution to to perform Pixory is to simply run&nbsp;the Java program and allow it to use its own&nbsp;server</li>
	<li>Problems using Core with Pixory</li>
	<li>Selenium IDE is a plug-in for Firefox and consequently&nbsp;can go around these restrictions</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Running the Test Suite:</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>We basically desire to run the test suite</li>
	<li>using the Selenium IDE plugin TestRunner.html</li>
	<li>TestRunner Demo</li>
	<li>Run Evaluations created within the Firefox</li>
	<li>TestRunner</li>
</ul>
